# Ihsan Agile Development Roadmap

This roadmap reflects our current thinking but is shaped by community needs. As a framework grounded in *shūrā* (consultation), we're learning where this should go through collaboration with pilot organizations and contributors.

## Version 1.0 (Current) - Foundation
**Released: December 3, 2025**

- ✅ Complete framework documentation (33-page Guide)
- ✅ Website with comprehensive resources
- ✅ Academic publication (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17794838)
- ✅ GitHub repository established
- ✅ Pilot programme recruitment launched
- ✅ CC BY-SA 4.0 licensing

## Q1 2026 - Pilot Phase
**Focus: Real-world validation and refinement**

We're currently in the **learning phase**, discovering what works in practice.

- [ ] Seek and onboard a small cohort (approximately 3–5 organisations) for initial pilot trials (2–3 sprints each)
- [ ] Document implementation challenges and adaptations
- [ ] Create case study template
- [ ] Refine IAF role based on practice
- [ ] Build template library from pilot experiences
- [ ] Design and evaluate a long-term stewardship and governance model (with CIC as a leading candidate), informed by pilot outcomes and community consultation

**What we'll learn:**
- Which practices resonate most with different contexts
- How the IAF role works in reality
- What resources teams actually need
- How to adapt for diverse organizational cultures

## Q2 2026 - Learning & Documentation
**Focus: Capture and share learnings from pilots**

- [ ] Publish first 2-3 case studies from pilot organizations
- [ ] Expand practical resource library based on real implementations
- [ ] Create 15-minute "Quick Start" guide
- [ ] Develop IAF training outline
- [ ] Framework refinements based on pilot feedback
- [ ] Plan for Version 1.1 incorporating pilot learnings

## Q3 2026 - Accessibility & Reach
**Focus: Multilingual access and broader adoption**

- [ ] Translation program launch
  - [ ] Arabic translation (priority - language of Qur'an and Sunnah)
  - [ ] Additional languages based on pilot organization needs and contributor availability
  - [ ] Initial candidates: Urdu, Bengali, Indonesian/Malay, Turkish, French, Persian
  - [ ] Welcome community-led initiatives for additional languages
- [ ] Create translation style guide
- [ ] Establish translation review process with native speakers
- [ ] Support community translation efforts with documentation and resources
- [ ] Workshop format development
- [ ] Invite a second pilot cohort, subject to learning from initial pilots

**Translation priorities will be guided by:**
- Pilot organization locations
- Contributor availability and expertise
- Community requests and demand signals
- Strategic reach to underserved communities

## Q4 2026 - Ecosystem Development
**Focus: Community sustainability**

- [ ] Certification framework design (following Scrum.org model)
- [ ] IAF training program development
- [ ] Potential partnerships with Islamic educational institutions
- [ ] Establish contributor recognition program
- [ ] Release Version 1.1 with pilot-informed refinements

## 2027 - Governance & Scale
**Focus: Long-term sustainability**

### Q1 2027
- [ ] Formalise a community-governed stewardship model with partners (CIC as a likely structure)
- [ ] Launch certification beta program
- [ ] Establish regional community chapters

### Q2-Q4 2027
- [ ] Scale pilot programs
- [ ] Conference presentations and academic partnerships
- [ ] Research collaborations tracking framework impact
- [ ] Explore integration with existing Islamic finance/tech ecosystems

## Beyond 2027
**Vision: Sustainable ecosystem**

Long-term hopes (recognizing these will be shaped by community):
- Version 2.0 with expanded theological foundations
- Self-sustaining through training/certification (Scrum.org model)
- Thriving contributor community
- Integration with other Muslim tech initiatives
- Evidence-based research on framework impact

## What We're Uncertain About

We're honest about what we don't yet know:
- Whether the IAF role works as envisioned across different contexts
- Which practices will resonate most with teams
- What governance structure best serves the community long-term

## Our Commitment

We commit to:
- Learning from pilot organizations and adapting based on real experiences
- Transparent development process and community ownership
- Remaining true to Islamic values while serving diverse contexts
- Practicing the *shūrā* we advocate - the roadmap emerges from collective wisdom

The framework belongs to the ummah, not to any individual.
