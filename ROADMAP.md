# Ihsan Agile Development Roadmap

This roadmap reflects our current thinking but is shaped by community needs. As a framework grounded in *shūrā* (consultation), we're learning where this should go through collaboration with pilot organizations and contributors.

## Version 1.1 (Current) - Enhanced Framework
**Release: January 20, 2026**

✅ Complete framework documentation (66-page Guide)  
✅ Introduction of Ihsan Agile Product Steward (IAPS) role  
✅ Technical Disclosure framework replacing "technical debt"  
✅ Technical Uncertainty Register (TUR) artifact  
✅ Gharar Assessment Checklist  
✅ Enhanced Definition of Done with technical disclosure criteria  
✅ Expanded practical scenarios and implementation guidance  
✅ Academic publication (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17794838)  
✅ Website with comprehensive resources  
✅ GitHub repository with templates and tools  
✅ CC BY-SA 4.0 licensing  

**Key additions in v1.1:**
- Product Steward role addressing the operational gap between high-level Islamic values and daily product decisions
- Reframing of "technical debt" as "technical disclosure" to eliminate riba-based thinking and reduce gharar
- Practical tools for transparent stakeholder engagement
- Critical analysis of conventional Product Owner frameworks from Islamic perspective
- Three detailed worked scenarios demonstrating IAF and IAPS collaboration

## Q1 2026 - Pilot Phase & Initial Learning
**Focus: Real-world validation of both IAF and IAPS roles**

We're currently in the **learning phase**, discovering what works in practice.

### Dual-Track Piloting
- [ ] Seek and onboard pilot cohort (3–5 organisations) for 2–3 sprints each:
  - [ ] IAF-focused pilots (process and team practices)
  - [ ] IAPS-focused pilots (product stewardship and technical disclosure)
  - [ ] Combined IAF+IAPS pilots (comprehensive implementation)
- [ ] Document implementation challenges and adaptations for both roles
- [ ] Create role-specific case study templates
- [ ] Refine IAF and IAPS roles based on practice
- [ ] Build template library from pilot experiences (TUR templates, Gharar Assessment adaptations, etc.)
- [ ] Track technical disclosure effectiveness and stakeholder trust metrics

**What we'll learn:**
- How the IAF role works across different team contexts
- Whether the IAPS role effectively bridges the implementation gap
- How Technical Uncertainty Register functions as transparency tool vs. liability list
- Whether Gharar Assessment helps teams make better disclosure decisions
- Which practices resonate most with different contexts (fintech vs. charity vs. general tech)
- How to adapt for diverse organizational cultures and team sizes
- Relationship between IAPS and existing Shariah governance structures

### Research Partnerships
- [ ] Invite academic researchers to study IAPS implementation
- [ ] Comparative studies: Product Owner vs. Product Steward approaches
- [ ] Impact of technical disclosure on stakeholder trust
- [ ] Relationship between operational stewardship and Shariah governance

## Q2 2026 - Learning & Documentation
**Focus: Capture and share learnings from pilots**

- [ ] Publish first 2-3 case studies from pilot organizations
  - [ ] At least one IAPS-focused case study
  - [ ] Documentation of Technical Disclosure framework in practice
  - [ ] Gharar Assessment real-world applications
- [ ] Expand practical resource library based on real implementations
  - [ ] TUR templates refined from pilot experiences
  - [ ] Gharar Assessment Checklist adaptations for different contexts
  - [ ] Technical disclosure communication templates
- [ ] Create 15-minute "Quick Start" guides:
  - [ ] Quick Start for IAF role
  - [ ] Quick Start for IAPS role
  - [ ] Quick Start for Technical Uncertainty Register
- [ ] Develop training outlines:
  - [ ] IAF training outline
  - [ ] IAPS training outline (including technical disclosure governance)
- [ ] Framework refinements based on pilot feedback
- [ ] Plan for Version 1.2 incorporating pilot learnings

---

## Q3 2026 - Accessibility & Reach
**Focus: Multilingual access and broader adoption**

- [ ] Translation program launch
  - [ ] Arabic translation (priority - language of Qur'an and Sunnah)
  - [ ] Additional languages based on pilot organization needs and contributor availability
  - [ ] Initial candidates: Urdu, Bengali, Indonesian/Malay, Turkish, French, Persian
  - [ ] Welcome community-led initiatives for additional languages
- [ ] Create translation style guide (considering Islamic terminology)
- [ ] Establish translation review process with native speakers
- [ ] Support community translation efforts with documentation and resources
- [ ] Workshop format development (IAF and IAPS training)
- [ ] Invite a second pilot cohort, subject to learning from initial pilots

**Translation priorities will be guided by:**
- Pilot organization locations
- Contributor availability and expertise
- Community requests and demand signals
- Strategic reach to underserved communities
- Access to qualified reviewers for Islamic terminology

---

## Q4 2026 - Ecosystem Development
**Focus: Community sustainability**

- [ ] Certification framework design (following Scrum.org model):
  - [ ] IAF certification pathway
  - [ ] IAPS certification pathway
  - [ ] Combined IAF+IAPS advanced certification
- [ ] Training program development:
  - [ ] IAF training program
  - [ ] IAPS training program (including Technical Disclosure framework)
  - [ ] Technical Uncertainty Register workshop
  - [ ] Gharar Assessment training module
- [ ] Potential partnerships with Islamic educational institutions
- [ ] Establish contributor recognition program
- [ ] Release Version 1.2 with pilot-informed refinements
- [ ] Explore integration with Islamic finance/fintech ecosystems

---

## 2027 - Governance & Scale
**Focus: Long-term sustainability**

### Q1 2027
- [ ] Formalise community-governed stewardship model with partners (CIC as likely structure)
- [ ] Launch certification beta program (IAF and IAPS tracks)
- [ ] Establish regional community chapters
- [ ] Research synthesis: Publish findings on IAPS role effectiveness

### Q2-Q4 2027
- [ ] Scale pilot programs
- [ ] Conference presentations and academic partnerships:
  - [ ] Islamic finance conferences (IAPS role and technical disclosure)
  - [ ] Agile conferences (values-based frameworks)
  - [ ] Academic research on Product Steward vs. Product Owner approaches
- [ ] Research collaborations tracking framework impact
- [ ] Explore deeper integration with existing Islamic finance/tech ecosystems
- [ ] Document relationship between IAPS and Shariah supervisory boards

---

## Beyond 2027
**Vision: Sustainable ecosystem**

Long-term hopes (recognizing these will be shaped by community):
- Version 2.0 with expanded theological foundations and refined role definitions
- Self-sustaining through training/certification (Scrum.org model)
- Thriving contributor community
- Integration with other Muslim tech initiatives (Muslim Tech Manifesto, Islamic fintech standards)
- Evidence-based research on framework impact, particularly:
  - Technical disclosure effectiveness vs. conventional technical debt management
  - Stakeholder trust metrics in IAPS vs. traditional Product Owner contexts
  - Long-term product sustainability and ethical outcomes
- Potential influence on mainstream Agile frameworks through demonstrated success

## What We're Uncertain About

We're honest about what we don't yet know:
- Whether the IAF role works as envisioned across different contexts
- Whether the IAPS role effectively addresses the implementation gap we've identified
- How Technical Uncertainty Register scales in large organizations
- Whether Gharar Assessment provides practical value or becomes bureaucratic
- How IAPS role relates to existing Shariah governance in practice (complementary? overlapping?)
- Which practices will resonate most with teams
- What governance structure best serves the community long-term
- Whether our critique of conventional Product Owner frameworks resonates with practitioners

---

## Our Commitment

We commit to:
- Learning from pilot organizations and adapting based on real experiences, especially regarding the new IAPS role
- Transparent development process and community ownership
- Remaining true to Islamic values while serving diverse contexts
- Practicing the *shūrā* we advocate - the roadmap emerges from collective wisdom
- Honest evaluation of whether Technical Disclosure framework proves more effective than conventional technical debt management
- Willingness to revise or remove practices that don't serve teams in reality

**The framework belongs to the ummah, not to any individual.**
