# Stakeholder Barakah Review  
*A lightweight consultation for maṣlaḥah, justice, and trust*

---

## Purpose

The Stakeholder Barakah Review is a short, structured consultation to assess whether delivered work created **genuine benefit (maṣlaḥah)**, upheld **justice (ʿadl)**, and honoured **stewardship (amānah)** — with those affected, not just internally.

This is **not** a demo, satisfaction survey, or compliance audit.  
It is **shūrā as worship**, embedded into normal delivery rhythms.

---

## When to Run

- During **Sprint Review** (final 10–15 minutes), **or**
- After significant releases, experiments, or changes

**Frequency**
- High-impact products: every sprint  
- Lower-risk work: periodically (e.g. monthly or milestone-based)

---

## Who Attends

- Delivery team (listen-first stance)
- Product Owner
- Ihsan Agile Facilitator (facilitates)
- **Actual stakeholders**, such as:
  - users or beneficiaries
  - customers or partners
  - affected communities
  - future maintainers (where relevant)

---

## Duration

**15–20 minutes**

Consistency matters more than depth.  
Barakah comes from regular, honest reflection — not long sessions.

---

## Suggested Structure

### 1. Re-grounding in Intention (1–2 min)

The Ihsan Agile Facilitator reads the original **Sprint Niyyah** aloud:

> *“We intended this work to serve ___ by ___.”*

This anchors the review in **purpose**, not performance.

---

### 2. Stakeholder Reflection (8–10 min)

Stakeholders speak first.  
The team listens.

Ask the following **four fixed questions**:

#### 1. Genuine Benefit
- Did this create genuine benefit?
- For whom specifically?
- Who benefited less than expected?

#### 2. Justice & Fairness
- Did this feel fair and respectful?
- Did anyone carry burdens or risks they did not expect?

#### 3. Unintended Harms
- What did not go as hoped?
- Were there negative side-effects, confusion, pressure, or exclusion?

#### 4. Learning & Next Signals
- What should we measure or pay attention to next?
- What would tell us we are drifting away from maṣlaḥah?

**Facilitation guidance**
- Do not defend
- Do not explain away
- Clarifying questions are allowed
- Justifications are not

---

### 3. Team Reflection (5 min)

The team reflects briefly:

- What surprised us?
- What assumptions were challenged?
- What responsibility do we carry forward?

Capture **1–2 concrete follow-ups** only.

---

### 4. Close with Accountability (2 min)

The Facilitator closes by confirming:
- One key insight to carry forward
- One adjustment or experiment to try next
- Where follow-ups will be tracked (e.g. backlog, TUR, DoD, policy)

---

## Outputs (Lightweight but Real)

Each Barakah Review should produce:
- 3–5 brief notes (not a report)
- Any identified harms → visible follow-up
- Trust-impacting issues → Product Owner review
---

## What This Review Is *Not*

- ❌ Not a demo replacement  
- ❌ Not a satisfaction score  
- ❌ Not a Shariah ruling  
- ❌ Not a performance evaluation  
- ❌ Not a one-off ethics checkbox  

---

## Signs the Review Is Working

- Stakeholders raise concerns earlier
- Teams slow down *before* harm occurs
- Language shifts from “we shipped” to “we learned”
- Trust increases even when outcomes are imperfect

---

## Notes

- Keep the review **short, consistent, and honest**
- Treat discomfort as information, not failure
- Barakah is discovered through listening, not assumed
