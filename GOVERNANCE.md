# Governance

## Overview

Ihsan Agile is an open, non‑commercial, research‑led framework for embedding Islamic ethical principles into Agile delivery, digital product development, and organisational decision‑making.

The framework is intentionally **open source**, **non‑proprietary**, and **community‑oriented**. It is designed to evolve through scholarly engagement, practitioner feedback, and real‑world application rather than through formal corporate hierarchy.

This governance document clarifies how Ihsan Agile is stewarded, how decisions are made, and how contributions are invited, in line with best practices for open research frameworks and open standards.

## Organisational Form

Ihsan Agile operates as an **open research framework**, not as a registered company, charity, or commercial product.

It is best understood as:

* an open methodological framework
* a body of published guidance and practices
* a shared vocabulary for ethical Agile delivery
* a participatory research initiative

This form is common to open standards, academic frameworks, and practitioner‑led methodologies that prioritise transparency and public benefit over ownership or control.

## Stewardship

Ihsan Agile is currently stewarded by its founding author.

**Founding Author and Steward**:
**Dr. David Wallace-Hare**

The role of the **Founding Steward** is to:

* maintain coherence with the framework’s stated principles
* curate and version official guidance
* safeguard the non‑commercial, open‑source nature of the work
* ensure appropriate attribution and licensing
* invite and integrate feedback from practitioners and researchers

Stewardship is an obligation of care, not a claim of authority. The steward does not act as a gatekeeper of ideas, nor as a certifying or accrediting body.

## Decision‑Making

Decisions about the evolution of Ihsan Agile are guided by:

1. Alignment with published principles (niyyah, iḥsān, maṣlaḥah, stewardship, shūrā, tazkiyah)
2. Empirical learning from real‑world application
3. Scholarly critique and ethical reasoning
4. Practitioner feedback and community consultation

There is no centralised executive committee. Direction emerges through transparent publication, documented rationale, and reflective iteration.

---

## Contributions

Ihsan Agile welcomes contributions in many forms, including:

* issue reports and critical feedback
* proposed refinements to practices or terminology
* case studies and implementation reflections
* research collaboration and comparative analysis
* translations and contextual adaptations

Contributions are evaluated on their clarity, ethical reasoning, and alignment with the framework’s purpose rather than on institutional status or credentials.

---

## Licensing and Use

All official Ihsan Agile materials are released under the **Creative Commons Attribution‑ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY‑SA 4.0)** licence unless otherwise stated.

This means:

* the framework may be freely used, shared, and adapted
* commercial and non‑commercial use is permitted
* attribution is required
* adaptations must be shared under the same licence

This licensing choice is intentional and reflects a commitment to openness, shared benefit, and collective improvement.

---

## Relationship to Organisations and Institutions

Ihsan Agile is independent of any single organisation.

It may be:

* piloted within charities, NGOs, startups, and teams
* studied by researchers and academic institutions
* referenced in training, teaching, or consultancy contexts

Such use does not imply endorsement, ownership, or governance control by those organisations, nor does Ihsan Agile claim to represent them.

---

## Future Evolution

As adoption and scholarly engagement grow, governance arrangements may evolve to support:

* broader community stewardship
* formal research partnerships
* advisory or review structures

Any such evolution will be publicly documented and guided by the same principles of transparency, consultation, and ethical responsibility that underpin the framework itself.

## Contact and Engagement

Researchers, practitioners, and organisations interested in contributing to or studying Ihsan Agile are encouraged to engage through the public repository or via the project website.

Ihsan Agile remains intentionally open, lightweight, and adaptive — prioritising ethical clarity, trust, and service over institutional formality.
