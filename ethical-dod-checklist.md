# Ethical Definition of Done Checklist

Expand your Definition of Done to include ethical and Islamic criteria, ensuring work embodies the Three Pillars: Niyyah (intention), Iḥsān (excellence), and Maṣlaḥah (public good).

## How to Use This

1. **Start with your existing DoD** (tests pass, code reviewed, etc.)
2. **Add 2-3 ethical criteria** from the list below
3. **Adapt to your context** (fintech needs different criteria than a blog)
4. **Make them non-negotiable** - work isn't "Done" until ethical criteria are met
5. **Review quarterly** - refine based on what you learn in Muhāsabah retrospectives

## Core Principles

**Remember:** Definition of Done is not just functional completeness, it's **ethical completeness**. We're ensuring work:
- Honors the **niyyah** (intention) we set
- Meets standards of **iḥsān** (excellence with God-consciousness)  
- Genuinely serves **maṣlaḥah** (public good)
- Avoids creating **ethical debt**

## Continuous Growth (Tazkiyah)

**Tazkiyah** (تَزْكِيَة) means purification and growth - the gradual refinement of both skills and character. Definition of Done should create learning opportunities, which are then explored deeply in Muhāsabah Retrospectives.

*"Successful indeed are those who purify themselves,remember the Name of their Lord, and pray."* (Qur'an 87:14-15, transl. Mustafa Khattab, The Clear Quran)

### Learning Criteria

- [ ] **Learning captured** - What we learned documented for future reference
- [ ] **Reflection time honored** - Team had space to think, not just execute frantically

### How DoD Enables Tazkiyah

Definition of Done sets the **standard** we hold ourselves to.  
Muhāsabah Retrospectives are where we **honestly check** if we met that standard.  
Tazkiyah is the **gradual growth** that emerges from honest accounting.

**The cycle:**
1. DoD defines what "done" means (including ethical criteria)
2. Team does work with consciousness
3. Retrospective asks: "Did we actually meet our DoD?" (Muhāsabah - honest accounting)
4. Team recognizes where they fell short and why
5. Team commits to one habit to start or stop (Tawbah - commitment to change)
6. DoD criteria are refined based on learning
7. Team repeats with better habits (Tazkiyah - gradual purification)

**For detailed guidance** on how to use DoD as a mirror for growth, see the [Muhāsabah Retrospective Template](muhasabah-retrospective-template.md).

### Quick Integration Check

**After 3-4 sprints, the IAF or Scrum Master should ask:**
- Are we checking DoD honestly, or just claiming we did?
- Has DoD caught any real ethical issues?
- Are DoD criteria becoming more specific over time?
- Do retrospectives surface DoD-related insights?

**If always "no"** → DoD has become a checkbox, not a growth tool.

## Ethical Debt Management

### What Is Ethical Debt?

Just as technical debt creates future costs, **ethical debt** creates future harm:

| Type | Example | Consequence |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Accessibility debt** | "We'll add screen reader support later" | Excludes people with disabilities **now** |
| **Privacy debt** | "We'll tighten data collection later" | Violates user trust **now** |
| **Transparency debt** | "We'll simplify the terms later" | Misleads users **now** |
| **Sustainability debt** | "The team will recover after this sprint" | Burns people out **now** |
| **Consultation debt** | "We'll validate with users later" | Builds wrong thing **now** |
| **Security debt** | "We'll fix this vulnerability next sprint" | Exposes users to harm **now** |

### If You Must Accept Ethical Debt (rarely)

**Document it explicitly:**
- [ ] **Ethical debt acknowledged** - Documented in backlog as high-priority item
- [ ] **Mitigation plan exists** - Clear timeline and approach for addressing it
- [ ] **Impact understood** - Team knows who is harmed and how
- [ ] **Stakeholders informed** - Affected parties aware of the temporary limitation
- [ ] **Deadline set** - Committed timeline for resolution (not indefinite)

**Best practice:** Refuse ethical debt the same way you'd refuse brittle, untested code in production.

## Tips for Implementation

### Start Small
**Phase 1:** Add 1-2 universal criteria  
**Phase 2:** Add 1-2 context-specific criteria  
**Phase 3:** Add process integrity criteria  

Don't overwhelm the team with 20 new criteria on day one.

### Make It Concrete
**Vague:** "Accessible"  
**Concrete:** "Tested with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS), keyboard-navigable, color contrast ratio >4.5:1"

**Vague:** "User-friendly"  
**Concrete:** "Tested with 5 users from target demographic, all completed task without assistance"

### Assign Clear Responsibility
- **Who** checks each criterion?
- **When** in the workflow does it get checked?
- **How** is it verified (test, review, demo, user feedback)?

### Make It Visible
Don't hide DoD in a wiki. Display it:
- On the team board
- In sprint planning
- In code review templates
- In pull request checklists

### Review in Retrospectives (Muhāsabah)
Every retrospective should ask:
- "Did we actually check all DoD criteria this sprint?"
- "Are our criteria still relevant?"
- "Did any criterion catch an ethical issue? (If no, are we checking rigorously enough?)"
- "Do we need new criteria based on what we learned?"

### Don't Make It Bureaucratic
**Goal:** 2-5 minutes additional review time  
**Not:** Hours of checklist paperwork

If it takes hours, criteria are too vague or process is too heavy.

### Seasonal Adaptation
- **Ramadan:** Extra emphasis on sustainable pace
- **Dhul Hijjah:** Reflection on intention and service
- **Year-end:** Review and refresh criteria for next year

## What This Prevents

- Shipping features that violate Islamic values
- Creating ethical debt that harms users or team
- Compromising under pressure without conscious decision
- Building based on assumptions rather than consultation (gharar)
- Burnout from unsustainable pace
- Harm to vulnerable groups
- Erosion of trust with stakeholders

## What This Enables

- Team confidence in their work's ethical integrity
- Alignment between stated values and actual practice
- Early detection of ethical issues (when they're cheap to fix)
- Work that genuinely serves maṣlaḥah (public good)
- Sustainable pace that honors amānah toward team
- Culture of iḥsān (excellence with God-consciousness)
- Stakeholders trust that we mean what we say
- Continuous growth (tazkiyah) in both skill and character

---

## Reflection Questions for IAF

After several sprints using Ethical DoD:

- Are criteria becoming rote checkboxes or genuine ethical reflection?
- Has DoD caught real ethical issues? (If no → criteria may be too vague)
- Does team understand *why* each criterion matters?
- Are we creating ethical debt? If so, is it documented and prioritized?
- Do criteria reflect actual risks in our context, or generic best practices?
- Is DoD enabling tazkiyah (growth), or just compliance?

*"Verily, Allah has prescribed ihsan (proficiency, perfection) in all things."* (Hadith 17, 40 Hadith an-Nawawi, sunnah.com)

**Definition of Done is where we make iḥsān concrete and actionable.**
