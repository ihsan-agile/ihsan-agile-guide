# Ethical Definition of Done Checklist

Expand your Definition of Done to include ethical and Islamic criteria, ensuring work embodies the Three Pillars: Niyyah (intention), Iḥsān (excellence), and Maṣlaḥah (public good).

## How to Use This

1. **Start with your existing DoD** (tests pass, code reviewed, etc.)
2. **Add 2–3 ethical criteria** from the list below
3. **Adapt to your context** (fintech needs different criteria than a blog)
4. **Make them non-negotiable** – work isn't "Done" until ethical criteria are met
5. **Review quarterly** – refine based on what you learn in Muhāsabah retrospectives

## Core Principles

**Remember:** Definition of Done is not just functional completeness, it's **ethical completeness**. We're ensuring work:

- Honors the **niyyah** (intention) we set
- Meets standards of **iḥsān** (excellence with God-consciousness)
- Genuinely serves **maṣlaḥah** (public good)
- Avoids creating **ethical debt** that transfers harm or uncertainty to others without their knowledge

## Continuous Growth (Tazkiyah)

**Tazkiyah** (تَزْكِيَة) means purification and growth - the gradual refinement of both skills and character. Definition of Done should create learning opportunities, which are then explored deeply in Muhāsabah Retrospectives.

*"Successful indeed are those who purify themselves,remember the Name of their Lord, and pray."* (Qur'an 87:14-15, transl. Mustafa Khattab, The Clear Quran)

### Learning Criteria

- [ ] **Learning captured** - What we learned documented for future reference
- [ ] **Reflection time honored** - Team had space to think, not just execute frantically

### How DoD Enables Tazkiyah

Definition of Done sets the **standard** we hold ourselves to.  
Muhāsabah Retrospectives are where we **honestly check** if we met that standard.  
Tazkiyah is the **gradual growth** that emerges from honest accounting.

**The cycle:**
1. DoD defines what "done" means (including ethical criteria)
2. Team does work with consciousness
3. Retrospective asks: "Did we actually meet our DoD?" (Muhāsabah - honest accounting)
4. Team recognizes where they fell short and why
5. Team commits to one habit to start or stop (Tawbah - commitment to change)
6. DoD criteria are refined based on learning
7. Team repeats with better habits (Tazkiyah - gradual purification)

**For detailed guidance** on how to use DoD as a mirror for growth, see the [Muhāsabah Retrospective Template](muhasabah-retrospective-template.md).

### Quick Integration Check

**After 3-4 sprints, the IAF or Scrum Master should ask:**
- Are we checking DoD honestly, or just claiming we did?
- Has DoD caught any real ethical issues?
- Are DoD criteria becoming more specific over time?
- Do retrospectives surface DoD-related insights?

**If always "no"** → DoD has become a checkbox, not a growth tool.

## Ethical Debt, Gharar, and Declared Uncertainty

Ethical debt in Ihsan Agile does **not** mean imperfection, speed, or pragmatic trade-offs.

It refers to situations where **uncertainty, risk, or burden is introduced in a way that others may bear the consequences without full knowledge, consent, or recourse**.

In Islamic commercial ethics, this pattern is described as **gharar**:
harmful uncertainty arising from **information asymmetry**, not from risk itself.

Not all uncertainty is unethical.  
What matters is whether uncertainty is:

- disclosed or concealed  
- shared or unfairly transferred  
- actively stewarded or quietly normalised  

The concern is not *that* a shortcut was taken, but **who now carries the consequences — and whether they know**.

All technical limitations referenced here should also be recorded in the Technical Uncertainty Register (./technical-uncertainty-register.md); this section exists to assess whether any of those uncertainties create ethical risk through non-disclosure, unjust transfer of harm, or lack of consent.

---

## Using This Section Correctly (Important)

This section exists to **surface and challenge unresolved ethical concerns**, not to justify proceeding.

Recording an issue here does **not** make it acceptable.

Some forms of uncertainty:
- require escalation  
- require explicit disclosure or consent  
- require redesign or refusal  

Documentation without justice or consent does **not** resolve gharar.

---

## Declared Ethical Trade-offs and Unresolved Uncertainty

Use this table to make ethical risk visible **before it becomes normalised**.

| Area of concern | What uncertainty or harm is being introduced? | Who may bear the consequences? | Is this disclosed to them? | Steward / owner | Ethical status |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Example: Accessibility | Screen reader support incomplete | Users with visual impairments | Partially (release notes) | Product | ⚠ Requires escalation |
| Example: Financial clarity | Edge-case fees unclear | Low-income users | No | Compliance | ❌ Not acceptable |
| Example: Maintainability | Auth logic simplified | Future maintainers | Yes (documented) | Tech lead | ✅ Acceptable with review |

### Ethical status guidance

- **✅ Acceptable** – uncertainty is disclosed, proportionate, stewarded, and just  
- **⚠ Requires escalation** – disclosure or consent is incomplete; proceed only after review  
- **❌ Not acceptable** – uncertainty creates unjust harm or deception; must be addressed before release  

---

## Key Questions for the Facilitator (IAF)

When reviewing this table, ask:

- Are we naming uncertainty, or disguising it as “later work”?
- Who would be surprised if this caused harm?
- Are we relying on documentation where consent is actually required?
- Are we treating this as a temporary necessity, or quietly as the new normal?

> **IAF note**  
> The ethical failure is rarely the shortcut itself.  
> It is allowing uncertainty to persist in a way that transfers harm to people who did not agree to carry it.

---

## Non-Negotiable Boundary

Some ethical risks **cannot** be deferred, even if documented.

If proceeding would:

- mislead users  
- obscure financial or legal consequences  
- expose vulnerable groups to harm  
- transfer risk without consent  

then the work is **not ethically complete**, regardless of delivery pressure.

---

## Tips for Implementation

### Start Small
**Phase 1:** Add 1-2 universal criteria  
**Phase 2:** Add 1-2 context-specific criteria  
**Phase 3:** Add process integrity criteria  

Don't overwhelm the team with 20 new criteria on day one.

### Make It Concrete
**Vague:** "Accessible"  
**Concrete:** "Tested with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS), keyboard-navigable, color contrast ratio >4.5:1"

**Vague:** "User-friendly"  
**Concrete:** "Tested with 5 users from target demographic, all completed task without assistance"

### Assign Clear Responsibility
- **Who** checks each criterion?
- **When** in the workflow does it get checked?
- **How** is it verified (test, review, demo, user feedback)?

### Make It Visible
Don't hide DoD in a wiki. Display it:
- On the team board
- In sprint planning
- In code review templates
- In pull request checklists

### Review in Retrospectives (Muhāsabah)
Every retrospective should ask:
- "Did we actually check all DoD criteria this sprint?"
- "Are our criteria still relevant?"
- "Did any criterion catch an ethical issue? (If no, are we checking rigorously enough?)"
- "Do we need new criteria based on what we learned?"

### Don't Make It Bureaucratic
**Goal:** 2-5 minutes additional review time  
**Not:** Hours of checklist paperwork

If it takes hours, criteria are too vague or process is too heavy.

### Seasonal Adaptation
- **Ramadan:** Extra emphasis on sustainable pace
- **Dhul Hijjah:** Reflection on intention and service
- **Year-end:** Review and refresh criteria for next year

## What This Prevents

- Shipping features that violate Islamic values
- Creating ethical debt that harms users or team
- Compromising under pressure without conscious decision
- Building based on assumptions rather than consultation (gharar)
- Burnout from unsustainable pace
- Harm to vulnerable groups
- Erosion of trust with stakeholders

## What This Enables

- Team confidence in their work's ethical integrity
- Alignment between stated values and actual practice
- Early detection of ethical issues (when they're cheap to fix)
- Work that genuinely serves maṣlaḥah (public good)
- Sustainable pace that honors amānah toward team
- Culture of iḥsān (excellence with God-consciousness)
- Stakeholders trust that we mean what we say
- Continuous growth (tazkiyah) in both skill and character

---

## Reflection Questions for IAF

After several sprints using Ethical DoD:

- Are criteria becoming rote checkboxes or genuine ethical reflection?
- Has DoD caught real ethical issues? (If no → criteria may be too vague)
- Does team understand *why* each criterion matters?
- Are we creating ethical debt? If so, is it documented, disclosed, and prioritized in our workflows?
- Do criteria reflect actual risks in our context, or generic best practices?
- Is DoD enabling tazkiyah (growth), or just compliance?

*"Verily, Allah has prescribed ihsan (proficiency, perfection) in all things."* (Hadith 17, 40 Hadith an-Nawawi, sunnah.com)

**Definition of Done is where we make iḥsān concrete and actionable.**
