# Ethical Definition of Done Checklist

Expand your Definition of Done to include ethical and Islamic criteria, ensuring work embodies the Three Pillars: Niyyah (intention), Iḥsān (excellence), and Maṣlaḥah (public good).

## How to Use This

1. **Start with your existing DoD** (tests pass, code reviewed, etc.)
2. **Add 2–3 ethical criteria** from the list below
3. **Adapt to your context** (fintech needs different criteria than a blog)
4. **Make them non-negotiable** – work isn't "Done" until ethical criteria are met
5. **Review quarterly** – refine based on what you learn in Muhāsabah retrospectives

## Core Principles

**Remember:** Definition of Done is not just functional completeness, it's **ethical completeness**. We're ensuring work:

- Honors the **niyyah** (intention) we set
- Meets standards of **iḥsān** (excellence with God-consciousness)
- Genuinely serves **maṣlaḥah** (public good)
- Avoids creating **ethical debt** that transfers harm or uncertainty to others without their knowledge

## Continuous Growth (Tazkiyah)

**Tazkiyah** (تَزْكِيَة) means purification and growth - the gradual refinement of both skills and character. Definition of Done should create learning opportunities, which are then explored deeply in Muhāsabah Retrospectives.

*"Successful indeed are those who purify themselves,remember the Name of their Lord, and pray."* (Qur'an 87:14-15, transl. Mustafa Khattab, The Clear Quran)

### Learning Criteria

- [ ] **Learning captured** - What we learned documented for future reference
- [ ] **Reflection time honored** - Team had space to think, not just execute frantically

### How DoD Enables Tazkiyah

Definition of Done sets the **standard** we hold ourselves to.  
Muhāsabah Retrospectives are where we **honestly check** if we met that standard.  
Tazkiyah is the **gradual growth** that emerges from honest accounting.

**The cycle:**
1. DoD defines what "done" means (including ethical criteria)
2. Team does work with consciousness
3. Retrospective asks: "Did we actually meet our DoD?" (Muhāsabah - honest accounting)
4. Team recognizes where they fell short and why
5. Team commits to one habit to start or stop (Tawbah - commitment to change)
6. DoD criteria are refined based on learning
7. Team repeats with better habits (Tazkiyah - gradual purification)

**For detailed guidance** on how to use DoD as a mirror for growth, see the [Muhāsabah Retrospective Template](muhasabah-retrospective-template.md).

### Quick Integration Check

**After 3-4 sprints, the IAF or Scrum Master should ask:**
- Are we checking DoD honestly, or just claiming we did?
- Has DoD caught any real ethical issues?
- Are DoD criteria becoming more specific over time?
- Do retrospectives surface DoD-related insights?

**If always "no"** → DoD has become a checkbox, not a growth tool.

## Technical Disclosure and Gharar Management

**Critical reframing:** What conventional Agile calls "technical debt" becomes **technical disclosure** in Ihsan Agile.

Technical shortcuts themselves aren't prohibited. Rapid prototyping, market validation, and emergency responses serve legitimate purposes.

The issue is **how we approach them**: treating shortcuts as hidden "debt" we manage internally, rather than disclosed constraints requiring transparency and, where appropriate, stakeholder consent.

### The Riba-Gharar Problem in Conventional Technical Debt

Conventional Product Owner guidance treats technical debt using explicit interest-based frameworks: "pay it back with interest." This creates two Islamic prohibitions simultaneously:

1. **Riba (Interest):** Normalizes interest-based thinking in product decisions
2. **Gharar (Harmful Uncertainty):** Risk is hidden from stakeholders; those who will bear consequences (users experiencing bugs, developers inheriting unmaintainable code, communities facing service disruptions) are not consulted or even informed

### From Technical Debt to Technical Disclosure

The stance shifts fundamentally:

| Conventional "Technical Debt" | Ihsan Agile "Technical Disclosure" |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Internal financial liability to manage | Risk transfer requiring stakeholder consent |
| "Can we afford to pay this back?" | "Have we been truthful with those affected?" |
| Hidden until it becomes crisis | Visible from the moment it's created |
| Measured by impact on team velocity | Measured by impact on stakeholder trust |
| Disclosed when convenient | Disclosed as moral obligation |
| Success = debt paid off | Success = stakeholders informed and consenting |

### Technical Disclosure Criteria for DoD

**For teams using Technical Uncertainty Register (TUR):**

- [ ] **TUR entry created** – Technical shortcuts documented immediately, not after they cause problems
- [ ] **Gharar Assessment completed** – If uncertainty affects stakeholders, assessment determines required disclosure level
- [ ] **Disclosure obligations fulfilled** – Based on assessment results:
  - Level 1 (Document): Entry exists in TUR
  - Level 2 (Inform): Stakeholders notified through appropriate channel
  - Level 3 (Consult): Stakeholder input obtained and documented
  - Level 4 (Obtain Consent): Explicit stakeholder consent recorded
- [ ] **Affected parties identified** – Clear documentation of who bears consequences (users, future maintainers, communities)
- [ ] **Mitigation plan exists** – How and when constraint will be addressed, with owner assigned

### Using This Section Correctly (Important)

This section exists to **surface and ensure transparent disclosure**, not to justify proceeding without it.

Recording an issue in TUR does **not** make it acceptable if disclosure obligations aren't fulfilled.

Some forms of uncertainty:
- Require escalation to leadership or Shariah board
- Require explicit disclosure and stakeholder consent before proceeding
- Require redesign or refusal, not deferral

Documentation without disclosure, consent, or justice does **not** resolve gharar.

### Integration with Technical Uncertainty Register

All technical limitations should be recorded in the [Technical Uncertainty Register](technical-uncertainty-register.md).

This DoD section ensures:
1. Shortcuts are documented **immediately** (not later)
2. Gharar Assessment determines **required disclosure level**
3. Disclosure obligations are **fulfilled before marking work Done**
4. Team treats transparency as **moral obligation**, not risk management

**The ethical failure is rarely the shortcut itself.**  
**It is allowing uncertainty to persist in a way that transfers harm to people who did not agree to carry it.**

---

### Quick DoD Check for Technical Disclosure

Before marking work "Done," ask:

- [ ] Did we take any technical shortcuts this sprint?
- [ ] If yes: Is there a TUR entry for each one?
- [ ] For each TUR entry: Did we complete Gharar Assessment?
- [ ] For Level 2-4 assessments: Did we fulfill disclosure obligations?
- [ ] Can we honestly say affected stakeholders are informed, not surprised?

**If any answer is "no"** → Work is not ethically complete.

**For detailed guidance** on Technical Uncertainty Register and Gharar Assessment, see:
- [Technical Uncertainty Register Guide](technical-uncertainty-register.md)
- [Gharar Assessment Checklist](gharar-assessment-checklist.md)
  
### Ethical status guidance

- **✅ Acceptable** – uncertainty is disclosed, proportionate, stewarded, and just  
- **⚠ Requires escalation** – disclosure or consent is incomplete; proceed only after review  
- **❌ Not acceptable** – uncertainty creates unjust harm or deception; must be addressed before release  

---

## Key Questions for the Facilitator (IAF)

When reviewing this table, ask:

- Are we naming uncertainty, or disguising it as “later work”?
- Who would be surprised if this caused harm?
- Are we relying on documentation where consent is actually required?
- Are we treating this as a temporary necessity, or quietly as the new normal?

> **IAF note**  
> The ethical failure is rarely the shortcut itself.  
> It is allowing uncertainty to persist in a way that transfers harm to people who did not agree to carry it.

---

## Non-Negotiable Boundary

Some ethical risks **cannot** be deferred, even if documented.

If proceeding would:

- mislead users  
- obscure financial or legal consequences  
- expose vulnerable groups to harm  
- transfer risk without consent  

then the work is **not ethically complete**, regardless of delivery pressure.

---

## For Teams Adopting Technical Disclosure

If your team has adopted the **Ihsan Agile Product Steward (IAPS)** role and **Technical Uncertainty Register**:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprints 1-2)
**Add to DoD:**
- [ ] Technical shortcuts documented in TUR (if any taken this sprint)

**This establishes:** Immediate documentation habit

### Phase 2: Assessment (Sprints 3-4)
**Add to DoD:**
- [ ] Gharar Assessment completed for TUR entries affecting stakeholders
- [ ] Disclosure level identified (Document/Inform/Consult/Consent)

**This establishes:** Understanding of ethical risk in technical decisions

### Phase 3: Full Integration (Sprint 5+)
**Add to DoD:**
- [ ] Disclosure obligations fulfilled before marking Done
- [ ] Stakeholders appropriately informed/consulted based on assessment level
- [ ] TUR maintained as transparency tool (reviewed in retrospectives)

**This establishes:** Technical disclosure as standard practice, not exception

### Success Indicators
- Technical shortcuts documented same work session, not later
- Gharar Assessments become natural part of technical decision-making
- Stakeholders report feeling informed, not surprised
- Team treats disclosure as fulfilling amānah, not as bureaucracy

---

## Tips for Implementation

### Start Small
**Phase 1:** Add 1-2 universal criteria  
**Phase 2:** Add 1-2 context-specific criteria  
**Phase 3:** Add process integrity criteria  

Don't overwhelm the team with 20 new criteria on day one.

### Make It Concrete
**Vague:** "Accessible"  
**Concrete:** "Tested with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS), keyboard-navigable, color contrast ratio >4.5:1"

**Vague:** "User-friendly"  
**Concrete:** "Tested with 5 users from target demographic, all completed task without assistance"

### Assign Clear Responsibility
- **Who** checks each criterion?
- **When** in the workflow does it get checked?
- **How** is it verified (test, review, demo, user feedback)?

### Make It Visible
Don't hide DoD in a wiki. Display it:
- On the team board
- In sprint planning
- In code review templates
- In pull request checklists

### Review in Retrospectives (Muhāsabah)
Every retrospective should ask:
- "Did we actually check all DoD criteria this sprint?"
- "Are our criteria still relevant?"
- "Did any criterion catch an ethical issue? (If no, are we checking rigorously enough?)"
- "Do we need new criteria based on what we learned?"

### Don't Make It Bureaucratic
**Goal:** 2-5 minutes additional review time  
**Not:** Hours of checklist paperwork

If it takes hours, criteria are too vague or process is too heavy.

### Seasonal Adaptation
- **Ramadan:** Extra emphasis on sustainable pace
- **Dhul Hijjah:** Reflection on intention and service
- **Year-end:** Review and refresh criteria for next year

## What This Prevents

- Shipping features that violate Islamic values
- Creating gharar through undisclosed technical constraints that harm users or team
- Treating technical shortcuts as hidden "debt" instead of disclosed constraints requiring transparency
- Compromising under pressure without conscious decision
- Building based on assumptions rather than consultation (gharar)
- Burnout from unsustainable pace
- Harm to vulnerable groups
- Erosion of trust with stakeholders

## What This Enables

- Team confidence in their work's ethical integrity
- Alignment between stated values and actual practice
- Early detection of ethical issues (when they're cheap to fix)
- Work that genuinely serves maṣlaḥah (public good)
- Sustainable pace that honors amānah toward team
- Culture of iḥsān (excellence with God-consciousness)
- Stakeholders trust that we mean what we say
- Continuous growth (tazkiyah) in both skill and character
- Transparent technical disclosure that builds stakeholder trust
- Technical constraints treated as disclosed limitations, not hidden liabilities
- Stakeholders who feel informed rather than surprised by limitations
- Fulfillment of amānah through transparency about what we've built and its constraints

---

## Reflection Questions for IAF

After several sprints using Ethical DoD:

- Are criteria becoming rote checkboxes or genuine ethical reflection?
- Has DoD caught real ethical issues? (If no → criteria may be too vague)
- Does team understand *why* each criterion matters?
- Are we creating ethical debt? If so, is it documented, disclosed, and prioritized in our workflows?
- Do criteria reflect actual risks in our context, or generic best practices?
- Is DoD enabling tazkiyah (growth), or just compliance?
- Are we documenting technical shortcuts immediately, or only when they become problems?
- Is our Technical Uncertainty Register a transparency tool or a hidden liability list?
- Do stakeholders learn about limitations from us, or by discovering bugs?
- Are we treating technical disclosure as moral obligation or risk management?

---

*"Verily, Allah has prescribed ihsan (proficiency, perfection) in all things."* (Hadith 17, 40 Hadith an-Nawawi, sunnah.com)

**Definition of Done is where we make iḥsān concrete and actionable.**
