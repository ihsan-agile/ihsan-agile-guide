**Embedding Islamic Values in Agile Delivery**

A framework for Muslim-led teams and organisations to use Agile methodologies as a vehicle for *iḥsān* (excellence with God-consciousness).

## 📖 About

Ihsan Agile overlays existing Agile methods (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe) with principles drawn from the Qur'an and Sunnah. It transforms Agile delivery practices into a form of *'ibādah* (worship) by embedding *niyyah* (intention), *iḥsān* (excellence with God-consciousness), and *shūrā* (consultation) into team workflows and organisational practices.

This framework helps Muslim-led teams align daily operational decisions with Islamic values through:
- **Three Pillars**: Niyyah (Intention), Iḥsān (Excellence with God-consciousness), Maṣlaḥah (Public Good)
- **Five Core Principles**: Taqwā, Stewardship, Shūrā, Service & Justice, Continuous Growth
- **Ihsan Agile Facilitator Role**: Embedding values into daily Agile ceremonies
