**Embedding Islamic Values in Agile Delivery**

## What is Ihsan Agile?

Ihsan Agile helps Muslim-led teams embed Islamic values into the Agile ceremonies and practices they already use. It overlays existing Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe) with principles from the Qur'an and Sunnah.

As Muslim-led organisations grow and scale, they naturally ask: **how do we translate Islamic principles into the daily Agile practices our teams already use?** Ihsan Agile provides a practical answer through systematic practices and the Ihsan Agile Facilitator role.

**The approach:** Enriches what teams already do, rather than replacing it—making values operational, systematic, and sustainable.

## Three Pillars

1. **Niyyah** (نِيَّة) - Intention: Clarify purpose and higher aim before building
2. **Iḥsān** (إِحْسَان) - Excellence with God-consciousness: Work as if Allah sees every detail
3. **Maṣlaḥah** (مَصْلَحَة) - Public Good: Orient toward genuine benefit, not output for its own sake

## Five Core Principles

1. **Taqwā** - God-consciousness in all actions
2. **Amānah & Khilāfah** - Stewardship and trusteeship
3. **Shūrā** - Consultation and collective wisdom
4. **ʿIbādah & ʿAdl** - Service as worship and justice
5. **Tazkiyah** - Continuous growth through reflection

## Who This Is For

* **Islamic fintech startups** building products for Muslim communities
* **Muslim software development teams** within larger organizations
* **Islamic charities and NGOs** using Agile for delivery
* **Values-driven tech organizations** seeking ethical frameworks
* **Muslim professionals** wanting work to reflect Islamic principles

## Key Practices

The framework introduces seven core practices:

1. **Niyyah Check-ins** - Intention-setting at planning
2. **Ethical Completeness** - Expanding Definition of Done
3. **Shūrā as Decision Practice** - Structured consultation
4. **Stewardship & Mīzān** - Sustainable pace and waste reduction
5. **Muhāsabah Retrospectives** - Ethical reflection
6. **Stakeholder Barakah Reviews** - Impact assessment with stakeholders
7. **Continuous Niyyah Alignment** - Regular purpose reconnection

## The Ihsan Agile Facilitator (IAF)

A companion-coach role that helps embed Islamic values into daily Agile practice by:

* Facilitating Niyyah check-ins at planning cycles
* Transforming retrospectives into Muhāsabah sessions
* Ensuring Definition of Done includes justice and stewardship
* Conducting Stakeholder Barakah Reviews
* Supporting Shūrā in decision-making

The IAF complements existing Agile roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, RTE) rather than replacing them.

*In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful*

**"What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you."**  
*(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 50, sunnah.com)*

May this work be a means of drawing closer to Allah, serving His creation with excellence, and achieving true success (*falāḥ*) in this world and the next.

Āmīn.
