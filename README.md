**Embedding Islamic Values in Agile Delivery**

## What is Ihsan Agile?

Ihsan Agile is a values-centred guide for Muslim-led teams and organisations using Agile methods.

It explores how Islamic ethical principles drawn from the Qur’an and Sunnah can be made *operational* within everyday Agile events, such as planning, review, and retrospective, without replacing existing frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban, or SAFe.

Rather than introducing a new methodology, Ihsan Agile offers an **ethical overlay**: a way of surfacing intention (*niyyah*), responsibility (*amānah*), consultation (*shūrā*), and public benefit (*maṣlaḥah*) at the points where delivery decisions are actually made.

Version 1.1 extends the framework by focusing more explicitly on **uncertainty, disclosure, and stewardship** in software and product delivery, particularly where conventional Agile language (e.g. “technical debt”) can obscure ethical responsibility or downstream impact.

The guide is practice-oriented and exploratory. It provides shared language, questions, and artefacts to support reflection and responsible decision-making, rather than prescribing fixed roles, outcomes, or organisational models.

## Three Pillars

1. **Niyyah** (نِيَّة) - Intention: Clarify purpose and higher aim before building
2. **Iḥsān** (إِحْسَان) - Excellence with God-consciousness: Work as if Allah sees every detail
3. **Maṣlaḥah** (مَصْلَحَة) - Public Good: Orient toward genuine benefit, not output for its own sake

## Five Core Principles

1. **Taqwā** - God-consciousness in all actions
2. **Amānah & Khilāfah** - Stewardship and trusteeship
3. **Shūrā** - Consultation and collective wisdom
4. **ʿIbādah & ʿAdl** - Service as worship and justice
5. **Tazkiyah** - Continuous growth through reflection

## Quick Start

### For Teams

## Who This Is For

* **Islamic fintech startups** building products for Muslim communities
* **Muslim software development teams** within larger organizations
* **Islamic charities and NGOs** using Agile for delivery
* **Values-driven tech organizations** seeking ethical frameworks
* **Muslim professionals** wanting work to reflect Islamic principles

## Key Practices (Version 1.1)

Version 1.1 of the Ihsan Agile Guide articulates **eight core practices**. These practices are designed to integrate Islamic ethical reasoning into existing Agile ways of working, with particular emphasis on intention, disclosure, stewardship, and responsibility.

The practices are intentionally **non-prescriptive** and may be adapted to different contexts.

1. **Niyyah Articulation**  
   Making intention explicit at moments of commitment, prioritisation, and delivery — particularly where trade-offs are accepted.

2. **Ethical Completeness**  
   Extending notions of “done” or “complete” to include justice, disclosure, and responsibility, not only functional or technical criteria.

3. **Disclosure of Uncertainty** *(expanded in v1.1)*  
   Actively identifying and communicating known technical, organisational, or ethical uncertainties that may affect users or stakeholders.

4. **Shūrā as a Decision Practice**  
   Structuring consultation around consequential decisions, especially where impacts are uneven, unclear, or deferred.

5. **Stewardship and Mīzān**  
   Attending to balance, sustainability, and long-term consequences across systems, people, and obligations.

6. **Product Stewardship Reflection** *(new in v1.1)*  
   Reflecting on how responsibility for user impact, trust, and disclosure is exercised over time, distinct from delivery facilitation.

7. **Muhāsabah-Oriented Retrospectives**  
   Reviewing outcomes, intentions, and consequences, including ethical and stakeholder impact, as part of continuous improvement.

8. **Continuous Niyyah Alignment**  
   Regularly reconnecting day-to-day work with higher purpose, particularly as scope, pressure, or incentives shift.

## Roles and Stewardship (Exploratory)

Version 1.1 introduces **two exploratory role concepts** intended to support ethical reflection and disclosure within Agile delivery. These are not prescribed roles, and teams may choose to adopt, adapt, combine, or ignore them.

### Ihsan Agile Facilitator (IAF)

A facilitative role focused on supporting ethical reflection within Agile events, such as intention-setting, consultation, and retrospectives. Where used, this role may be taken on by an existing team member (e.g. Scrum Master, coach, or rotating facilitator).

### Ihsan Agile Product Steward (IAPS)

A stewardship-oriented role concerned with surfacing and disclosing uncertainty, assumptions, and trade-offs embedded in product and technical decisions, particularly where these may affect users, stakeholders, or trust.

Both roles are presented as ways of framing responsibility rather than prescribed organisational positions. Their practical usefulness is intentionally left open to evaluation through pilot work and community feedback.

## Independent Evaluation

The Ihsan Agile GitHub repository — which contains the full Ihsan Agile Guide and supporting artefacts — was independently evaluated by the Muslim Open Source Foundation (MOSF) and recognised as a **Model Repository (67/70)**.

In their evaluation, MOSF wrote:

> “It represents a model repository for Islamic open-source frameworks.”

The evaluation assessed repository governance, licensing, documentation quality, community readiness, and the systematic integration of Islamic ethical principles into Agile delivery practices.

May this work be a means of drawing closer to Allah, serving His creation with excellence, and achieving true success (*falāḥ*) in this world and the next.
