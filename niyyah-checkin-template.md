# Niyyah Check-in Template

A brief ethical orientation before committing to work. Use this at the beginning of Sprint Planning, PI Planning, or other planning sessions to establish conscious intention before work.

---

## Purpose

The Niyyah Check-in is a short reflective practice used **before committing to work**.

Its purpose is to help teams pause and ask whether their **intentions, assumptions, and trade-offs** are aligned with honesty, responsibility, and care for others.

This practice does **not** aim to eliminate uncertainty or prevent difficult decisions.  
It exists to ensure that uncertainty is **acknowledged, disclosed, and stewarded**, rather than hidden or transferred to others unnoticed.

---

## When to Use

Use the Niyyah Check-in:

- at the start of a sprint or iteration
- before committing to high-risk or time-pressured work
- when trade-offs feel uncomfortable or unclear
- when uncertainty may affect users, communities, or future maintainers
- when inheriting or extending existing systems

This check-in typically takes **2–5 minutes**.

---

## What This Is (and Is Not)

- This is **not** a moral test or judgement.
- This is **not** a commitment to perfection.
- This is **not** a replacement for governance or review.

This is a moment of **orientation**:
> “What are we intending to do, and who might bear the consequences?”

## The Niyyah Check-in

### Question 1: Intention
**Why are we choosing this course of action now?**

Select all that apply:

- [ ] To serve users or communities more effectively
- [ ] To address an urgent or time-sensitive need
- [ ] To learn something that cannot be known in advance
- [ ] To meet an external constraint we cannot change
- [ ] To reduce longer-term harm or fragility

If none apply:

- [ ] We are acting primarily for convenience or speed
- [ ] We are deferring responsibility to a later time or team

Pause if intention is unclear or misaligned.

---

### Question 2: Beneficiaries and Burdens
**Who benefits from this decision, and who may bear its costs?**

Consider:

- [ ] Users or customers
- [ ] Communities affected by the system
- [ ] Future maintainers or operators
- [ ] Support, operations, or on-call staff
- [ ] People excluded or marginalised by design choices

Ask explicitly:

- [ ] Are benefits and burdens falling on the same people?
- [ ] Are any groups carrying risk without knowing it?

---

### Question 3: Uncertainty and Disclosure
**What uncertainty are we introducing, and who knows about it?**

Select all that apply:

- [ ] There are known limitations or shortcuts in this work
- [ ] There are assumptions that may not hold in all cases
- [ ] There are edge cases we are not addressing yet
- [ ] There are risks that will surface later or at scale

For each, ask:

- [ ] Has this uncertainty been named explicitly?
- [ ] Has it been documented in plain language?
- [ ] Do those who may be affected know it exists?

Undisclosed uncertainty preserves ignorance (jahalah) and creates the conditions for harm.

---

### Question 4: Harm and Stewardship
**What harm could arise if this uncertainty is misunderstood or forgotten?**

Consider whether this decision could:

- [ ] Mislead users about reliability or completeness
- [ ] Violate trust (privacy, security, data use)
- [ ] Create avoidable fragility or burnout
- [ ] Burden future maintainers without context
- [ ] Cause exclusion, confusion, or inequity

Then ask:

- [ ] Who is responsible for noticing if harm begins to emerge?
- [ ] How will this responsibility be revisited over time?

Stewardship means responsibility does not disappear when work is shipped.

---

### Question 5: Necessity
**Is there a legitimate reason for accepting this uncertainty now?**

Legitimate necessity may include:

- [ ] Emergency or incident response
- [ ] Time-bounded external constraints
- [ ] Learning required before irreversible decisions

Not necessity:

- [ ] Chronic over-commitment
- [ ] Convenience or pressure to appear fast
- [ ] “We’ll fix it later” without capacity or intent

Necessity may justify introducing uncertainty.  
Necessity never justifies concealing it.

---

### Question 6: Next Right Action
**What is the most honest step we can take now?**

Select one or more:

- [ ] Proceed, with explicit disclosure and documentation
- [ ] Proceed, but consult affected stakeholders first
- [ ] Adjust scope to reduce harm or uncertainty
- [ ] Add safeguards, warnings, or mitigations
- [ ] Pause and escalate for further review

Clarity at this stage prevents harm later.

---

## Gharar (Uncertainty) Reflection

Gharar is used here as a **juristic lens**, not as a claim that all uncertainty is unethical or avoidable.

It draws attention to situations where:

- uncertainty is avoidable
- information is withheld
- others bear risk they did not knowingly accept

Ask:

- [ ] Where might ignorance (jahalah) persist if we proceed?
- [ ] What uncertainty would become unjust if left undisclosed?
- [ ] What needs to be made visible now to prevent harm later?

Addressing uncertainty begins with intention, but it must be carried through with action.

---

## Closing Reflection

Before committing, ask together:

> Are we acting with honesty about what we know and do not know,  
> and are we taking responsibility for how that uncertainty may affect others?

Niyyah does not remove uncertainty.  
It ensures uncertainty is **acknowledged before it is transferred**.
