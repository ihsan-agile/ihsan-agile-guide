# Niyyah Check-in Template

Use this at the beginning of Sprint Planning, PI Planning, or other planning sessions to establish conscious intention before work.

## Duration
2-3 minutes

## Facilitator Role
The Ihsan Agile Facilitator (IAF) or Scrum Master guides this practice.

## Islamic Foundation

*"The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended."* (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 1, sunnah.com)

This practice embodies the first of the Three Pillars: **Niyyah** (نِيَّة) - clarifying the purpose and higher aim of our work, transforming delivery from mere output into ʿibādah (worship through service).

## Process

### 1. Frame the Practice (30 seconds)

**IAF or Scrum Master says:**
> "Before we dive into planning, let's take a moment for niyyah - to clarify our intention and purpose. This isn't just about *what* we're building, but *why* it matters, *whom* it serves, and how it aligns with our commitment to work with iḥsān - excellence with God-consciousness."

### 2. Ask the Core Questions (1-2 minutes)

Go through these questions as a team. Brief discussion, not lengthy debate.

#### Question 1: Why are we building this? (Purpose)
- What is the higher purpose beyond the feature/sprint/release?
- How does this serve something meaningful?
- Does this work bring us closer to serving Allah's creation?

#### Question 2: Who benefits? Who might be harmed? (Maṣlaḥah)
- Who specifically will this help? Be concrete: "older users," "small business owners," "students"
- Who might we be overlooking or unintentionally harming?
- Are we making assumptions about beneficiaries without consulting them (violating shūrā)?

#### Question 3: What uncertainties remain? (Gharar Awareness)
- What don't we know yet that could affect the outcome?
- Are we building based on assumptions or validated understanding?
- What gharar (حَرَار - excessive uncertainty) should we reduce before committing?
  - Do we understand user needs?
  - Have we consulted stakeholders?
  - Are technical unknowns documented?

#### Question 4: What ethical debt are we avoiding or creating? (Stewardship)
- Are we taking shortcuts that compromise:
  - Accessibility (excluding people with disabilities)?
  - Privacy (unnecessary data collection)?
  - Transparency (dark patterns, hidden costs)?
  - Sustainability (burning out the team)?
  - Future maintainability (technical debt with ethical consequences)?
- What corners are we refusing to cut, even under pressure?

#### Question 5: How does this serve maṣlaḥah (public good)? (Verification)
- What genuine benefit does this create?
- How will we know it's beneficial vs. just busy work?
- Are we optimizing for real uplift or just vanity metrics?

### 3. Capture the Intention (30 seconds)

**Write one line** that captures the team's intention. Display it alongside the Sprint Goal throughout the sprint.

The intention should connect **what** you're building to **why** it serves Allah's creation.

#### Examples of Strong Intentions:

**Islamic Fintech:**
- "Building accessible zakat calculator so visually impaired users can fulfill their obligation with dignity and independence"
- "Simplifying halal investment onboarding to reduce gharar and help Muslims invest confidently according to their values"
- "Fixing critical security vulnerability to protect users' financial data and honor the amānah (trust) they've placed in us"

**Charity/NGO:**
- "Creating volunteer scheduling system to reduce admin burden on those managing a food bank, freeing them to serve more families"
- "Building donation tracking to give donors transparency and strengthen trust in our stewardship"

**General Tech:**
- "Improving search accessibility so users with screen readers can find information independently, serving their dignity"
- "Reducing page load time by 40% to honor users' time and data costs, especially those on limited connections"

#### Examples of Weak Intentions (to avoid):

❌ "Deliver features from backlog" ← No purpose, just process  
❌ "Make stakeholders happy" ← Vague, unmeasurable  
❌ "Hit sprint commitment" ← Process-focused, not purpose-focused  
❌ "Ship what was planned" ← No connection to benefit  

### 4. Brief Reflection (30 seconds)

**IAF or Scrum Master asks:**
> "Does this intention resonate? Does it clarify our purpose and who we serve? Any concerns about gharar or ethical debt we need to address before committing?"

**Red flags to surface:**
- "We don't actually know if users need this" → Gharar issue, needs validation
- "We'll have to skip accessibility to meet the deadline" → Ethical debt being created
- "This helps metrics but I'm not sure it helps people" → Maṣlaḥah concern

## Integration with Other Practices

**Connects to:**
- **Ethical Definition of Done**: The intention informs which ethical criteria matter most this sprint
- **Shūrā**: If uncertainties (gharar) are high, consultation is needed before committing
- **Muhāsabah Retrospectives**: Did we honor the intention we set? Where did we fall short?
- **Stakeholder Barakah Reviews**: Validate if the intention translated to actual benefit

## Gharar (Uncertainty) Deep Dive

**Why gharar matters in Agile:**

In Islamic finance, gharar (غَرَر) refers to excessive uncertainty or ambiguity in transactions. In Agile delivery, gharar manifests as:

- **Building without understanding user needs** → High uncertainty whether work serves real benefit
- **Committing without technical validation** → Uncertainty whether work is achievable
- **Assuming stakeholder preferences** → Uncertainty whether work aligns with actual needs
- **Skipping consultation** → Building in isolation increases uncertainty

**Reducing gharar through niyyah:**
- Surface what we don't know **before** committing
- Identify what consultation is needed (shūrā)
- Flag assumptions that need validation
- Acknowledge technical unknowns requiring spikes

**Not all uncertainty is gharar:**
- Agile embraces working with uncertainty through iteration
- Gharar is **excessive, avoidable** uncertainty from poor consultation or assumptions
- Valid uncertainty is acknowledged and managed; gharar is hidden or ignored

## Ethical Debt: What It Is

**Parallel to technical debt:**

Just as technical debt is shortcuts in code that create future costs, **ethical debt** is shortcuts in values that create future harm:

- **Accessibility debt**: "We'll add screen reader support later" → Excludes people now
- **Privacy debt**: "We'll tighten data collection later" → Violates trust now
- **Transparency debt**: "We'll simplify the terms later" → Misleads users now
- **Sustainability debt**: "The team will recover after this sprint" → Burns people out now
- **Consultation debt**: "We'll validate with users later" → Builds wrong thing now

**Making ethical debt explicit:**
- Like technical debt, acknowledge it consciously if accepting it
- Document the trade-off and mitigation plan
- Set a deadline for addressing it
- Make it visible (not hidden)

**Best practice:** Refuse ethical debt the same way you'd refuse brittle code in production.

## Tips for Success

**Keep it brief:** 2-3 minutes maximum. This clarifies work, it doesn't derail planning.

**Make it concrete:** Encourage specific answers. "Who benefits?" → "Elderly users who struggle with small text and high monthly data costs" not just "users."

**Display the intention:** Keep it visible during the sprint/iteration as a reminder.

**Revisit when needed:** If priorities shift mid-sprint, revisit the niyyah. Does the new priority serve the same purpose?

**Don't force spiritual language:** If non-Muslim team members are present, frame as "values-based purpose-setting." The practice works regardless of language used.

**Start small:** New teams might resist at first. Start with just "Who benefits?" and build from there.

**Empower pushback:** If niyyah reveals that work doesn't serve genuine benefit, the team should be empowered to challenge it.

## What This Prevents

- Building features no one needs (gharar - uncertainty about benefit)
- Losing sight of purpose under pressure
- Ethical drift and values compromise
- Creating ethical debt unconsciously
- Disconnection between stated values and actual work
- Paternalism (building for people without consulting them)

## What This Enables

- Meaningful work that serves Allah through serving His creation
- Clarity when making trade-offs under pressure
- Team alignment beyond just tasks
- Conscious stewardship of time, talent, and trust
- Work as a form of khidmah (service-worship)
- Early detection of gharar and ethical debt
- Moral courage to push back on harmful work

## Reflection Questions for IAF

After several sprints of practice, the IAF or Scrum Master should reflect:

- Is niyyah becoming habitual or feeling forced?
- Are intentions becoming formulaic or remaining genuine?
- Do intentions actually influence decisions, or are they just words?
- Does the team catch itself when drifting from stated intention?
- Are we discovering genuine maṣlaḥah or just rationalizing planned work?

*"What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you."* (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 50)

**Every sprint begins with intention. Every line of code is written in the sight of Allah.**
