# Niyyah Check-in Template

Use this at the beginning of Sprint Planning, PI Planning, or other planning
sessions to establish conscious intention before work.

## Duration
2–3 minutes

## Facilitator Role
The Ihsan Agile Facilitator (IAF) or Scrum Master guides this practice.

## Islamic Foundation

"The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the
reward according to what he has intended."
(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 1)

This practice embodies the first of the Three Pillars: **Niyyah** (نِيَّة) —
clarifying the purpose and higher aim of our work, transforming delivery from
mere output into ʿibādah (worship through service).

## Process

### 1. Frame the Practice (30 seconds)

**IAF or Scrum Master says:**

> "Before we dive into planning, let's take a moment for niyyah —
> to clarify our intention and purpose. This isn't just about what we're
> building, but why it matters, whom it serves, and how it aligns with our
> commitment to work with iḥsān — excellence with God-consciousness."

---

### 2. Ask the Core Questions (1–2 minutes)

Go through these questions as a team.
Brief discussion, not lengthy debate.

---

#### Question 1: Why are we building this? (Purpose)

- What is the higher purpose beyond the feature, sprint, or release?
- How does this serve something meaningful?
- Does this work bring us closer to serving Allah’s creation?

---

#### Question 2: Who benefits? Who might be harmed? (Maṣlaḥah)

- Who specifically will this help?
  Be concrete: "older users," "small business owners," "students"
- Who might we be overlooking or unintentionally harming?
- Are we making assumptions about beneficiaries without consulting them
  (violating shūrā)?

---

#### Question 3: What uncertainties remain? (Gharar Awareness)

- What don’t we know yet that could affect the outcome?
- Are we building based on assumptions or validated understanding?
- What gharar (غَرَر — harmful uncertainty) should we reduce before committing?

Examples to surface:
- Do we understand user needs?
- Have we consulted affected stakeholders?
- Are technical unknowns acknowledged and documented?

> Not all uncertainty is gharar.  
> Gharar refers to **avoidable uncertainty that causes harm through ignorance,
> false confidence, or lack of disclosure**, especially when others bear the
> consequences without knowing.

---

#### Question 4: What ethical risk are we introducing or accepting? (Stewardship)

Previously this has often been described as “ethical debt.”
What matters here is not the metaphor, but the reality:

- Are we introducing **risk, burden, or uncertainty** that others may have to
  live with?
- Do they know this risk exists?
- Are we relying on “we’ll fix it later” without clarity, ownership, or consent?

Reflect honestly:

- Are we taking shortcuts that affect:
  - Accessibility (excluding people with disabilities)?
  - Privacy (unnecessary data collection)?
  - Transparency (dark patterns, hidden costs)?
  - Sustainability (burning out the team)?
  - Future maintainability (leaving problems for others to discover)?
- What corners are we explicitly refusing to cut, even under pressure?

Some trade-offs may be unavoidable.
Concealing their impact is not.

---

#### Question 5: How does this serve maṣlaḥah (public good)? (Verification)

- What genuine benefit does this create?
- How will we know it helped people, not just activity or metrics?
- Are we optimising for real uplift or visible output?

---

### 3. Capture the Intention (30 seconds)

Write **one line** that captures the team’s intention.
Display it alongside the Sprint Goal throughout the sprint.

The intention should connect **what** you are building to **why** it serves
Allah’s creation.

---

#### Examples of Strong Intentions

**Islamic Fintech**
- "Building an accessible zakat calculator so visually impaired users can fulfil
  their obligation with dignity and independence."
- "Simplifying halal investment onboarding to reduce harmful uncertainty and help
  Muslims invest confidently according to their values."
- "Fixing a critical security vulnerability to protect users’ financial data and
  honour the amānah placed in us."

**Charity / NGO**
- "Creating a volunteer scheduling system to reduce admin burden on food-bank
  coordinators, freeing them to serve more families."
- "Building donation tracking to give donors transparency and strengthen trust in
  our stewardship."

**General Tech**
- "Improving search accessibility so users with screen readers can find
  information independently."
- "Reducing page load time to respect users’ time and data costs."

---

#### Examples of Weak Intentions (to avoid)

- "Deliver features from the backlog"
- "Make stakeholders happy"
- "Hit sprint commitment"
- "Ship what was planned"

These describe activity, not purpose.

---

### 4. Brief Reflection (30 seconds)

**IAF or Scrum Master asks:**

> "Does this intention resonate?
> Does it clarify who we serve?
> Are there concerns about uncertainty or ethical risk we should address
> before committing?"

**Red flags to surface:**
- "We don’t actually know if users need this" → Gharar concern
- "We’ll skip accessibility to meet the deadline" → Undisclosed ethical risk
- "This helps metrics but not people" → Maṣlaḥah concern

---

## Integration with Other Practices

This check-in connects to:

- **Ethical Definition of Done** — intention shapes which ethical criteria matter
- **Shūrā** — high uncertainty requires consultation
- **Muhāsabah retrospectives** — did we honour the intention we set?
- **Technical Uncertainty practices** — surfaced unknowns should not remain hidden

---

## Tips for Success

- Keep it brief — clarity, not ceremony.
- Make answers concrete.
- Display the intention visibly during the sprint.
- Revisit if priorities shift.
- Don’t force religious language with mixed teams.
- Let niyyah enable respectful pushback on harmful work.

---

## What This Prevents

- Building features no one needs
- Ethical drift under pressure
- Hidden uncertainty becoming normalised
- Quiet transfer of harm to users or future maintainers
- Confusing activity with benefit

---

## What This Enables

- Purpose-aligned delivery
- Clearer trade-offs under pressure
- Conscious stewardship of trust and impact
- Early surfacing of harmful uncertainty
- Moral courage to refuse work that contradicts values

"What is Ihsan?"
Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) replied:
"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not see Him,
know that He sees you."
(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 50)

Every sprint begins with intention.
Every line of code is written in the sight of Allah.
